# angular_gulp
This is a simple app in angularjs that lets you search and sort for gulp plugins with a few more advanced options such as github stars, forks, links to the plugin.  It uses angularjs, jquery and bootstrap 3.

Thanks to Erik Dasque for providing the compilation of plugin data for the front-end.
